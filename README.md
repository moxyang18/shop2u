# shop2u

## About The Project
shop2u is an on-campus shopping platform.  With this project, I realized role-based access control for customers, vendors and admins. shop2u has a variety of functionalities for vendors and administrators to manage the shops/products efficiently, and for users to make purchases, earn points upon each purchase, and redeem rewards.
